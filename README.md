# AdventOfCodeStarter

[![](https://markdown-videos.deta.dev/youtube/2P4N4ihe_lY)](https://youtu.be/2P4N4ihe_lY)

## How it works:

Clone this repo with the command:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/ZackDeRose/advent-of-code-starter.git
```

For each puzzle of the advent of code, this starter gives you:
+ a `.ts` file for your solution (in `src/day-X`)
+ a `.spec.ts` file for testing (also in `src/day-X`)
+ a `<a/b>.test.txt` file for your test data-set (in `data/day-X`)
+ a `<a/b>.txt` file for you to paste your full dataset (also in `data/day-X`).

The starting point we've generated will allow you to use the commands provided to pass the appropriate data set when running/testing your solution.

## Running Commands

Given you're on the first puzzle of day 1, here are the commands available:

### Run Your Code

```terminal
npx nx day-1-a
```

This will run your code in a node context against the full data set provided in `data/day-1/a.txt`

+ the `--watch` option can be added to add file watching (i.e.: `npx nx day-1-a --watch`)
+ the `--test-data` option can be added to run against your test data set found in the provided `data/day-1/a-test.txt` (i.e.: `npx nx day-1-a --test-data`);
+ these options can be combined (i.e.: `npx nx day-1-a --test-data --watch`)

### Run Tests

```terminal
npx nx test-day-1-a
```

This will run the test you can find in `src/day-1/a.spec.ts`.

The generated code in this file will already import and run your solution from `src/day-1/a.ts` against the data found in `data/day-1/a-test.txt`, but you are welcome to adjust this test code as needed.

+ the `--watch` option can be used to turn on file-watching for your test.
